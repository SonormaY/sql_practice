### Library Management System (3NF)

Design a relational database for a simple library system that stores information about books, authors, members, and borrowings. The system should track:

* Books (title, publication year, ISBN, author, genre)
* Authors (name, birthdate, nationality)
* Members (name, email, phone, address)
* Borrowing transactions (which member borrowed which book, borrow date, return date)

Your goal is to:

1. **Design the database schema** while ensuring it's in **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**.
2. **Write SQL code** to create the tables and enforce constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, etc.).
